# Anki-Deck-Flipper

This plugin is a meant to be used as a way to flip a deck (a deck whose cards' front side are the original deck's backside). It will also maintain the newly created deck if changes are made to the original deck.

Assuming a card that looks like this:

Front Side : Back Side

A card in the original deck might be:

OGQuestion : OG Answer

And in the flipped version it will be:

OG Answer : OG Question

## How to use: 

1)  Install the plugin
2)  Go to tools -> Deck Flipper
3)  Select the decks which you would like to be flipped and maintained. If a deck is not selectable or already checked, it means the flipped version of that deck already exists.

## Things to note:

1) After changing the original deck, you can either restart Anki or open the tool and press refresh.
2) This program is meant to work on only basic note models, with a simple "Front" and "Back" field (these are the kind of notes i used and have tested)
3) To flip a deck the deck's name must have no spaces. If there are any other kind of names that illicit errors in flipping please let me know!
4) The addon knows which deck is it's flipped version by it's name, if you change the name of the original deck the fliped deck's name should be changed accordingly

If there are any other problems or concerns please let me know! This is my first addon and it's a simple one but it's function is useful for me so hopefully it will also useful for you.
